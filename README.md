Group A :

Experiment No. 1 : Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the following
                   1.	Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
                   2.	Overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.
                   3.	Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
                   4.	Overload operators << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.

Experiment Number 2 : Develop a program in C++ to create a database of studentâ€™s information system
                      containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group,
                      Contactaddress, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. Construct
                      the database with suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy constructor,
                      destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception                           handling.
